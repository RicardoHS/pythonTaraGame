# pythonTaraGame
A python GUI game that uses alpha-beta pruning as IA logic.

The game is based on the TaraGame develop by Dijkstra and van Dijk. http://homepages.di.fc.ul.pt/~jpn/gv/tara.htm

# Issues
* The game is broken, its extremetly easy to win or to lose.

I doesnt understand the logic of the Tara game at all, probably the game logic is broken or maybe I'm not able yet to understand the rules with the poor description given in the webpage.

If any world famous tara player walks arround here, please take a minute and explain me how to play.
